NOTES:

*The IRC definition of 'username' is a username that CAN NOT BE CHANGED. *NOT* the nickname of a user.
	If you do a WHOIS on an IRC server for a user, you'll get the following response:
	[Nickname] (Username@Hostname): Realname

*I (Megagun) have registered UQMatchbot on FreeNode. The bot has +v on #uqm-arena. If you want to host the bot on there, ask me for the ident password. :)

*If using NetBeans, use licenses/license-short.txt for the project license, so that it gets embedded in all files neatly. :)

*The configuration of a bot is currently handled through ini4j. Use (and modify!) the following text and save it as 'uqmatchbot_conf.ini' for epicness:
;UQMatchbot configuration file
;Note that there are several 'defaults' that are used if these aren't specified. See the code for details.
;Not all of these settings need to be specified. some are optional
